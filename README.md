This VBA project allows you to find the cheapst VM size for a given Core/Ram configuration in a specific datacenter.
You can then pull an hour price for the VM. 

The solution relies on a custom backend, that pulls data from https://azure.microsoft.com/api/v2/pricing

It uses a custom service for retrieving VM prices
